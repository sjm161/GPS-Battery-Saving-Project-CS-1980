---------------------
*Have Dr. Mosse send us the simulator and review its functionality
*Create a basic "hello world" Android application to get a base to work off of
*Research how we can modulate the power state of the GPS device

REVIEW:
Dr. Mosse did not return our email and thus we were unable to look over the simulator, another email will be sent
A basic Android application was made to get a base layer to work with
Initial research into how to modulate the power state of the GPS was done and according to what we could find it seems rather hacky and differs between Android versions, some implementations we saw even had to use an exploit which has since been patched

9/27/2019 - 10/4/2019 (Stephen Marhefka)
---------------------
*Send another email to Dr. Mosse requesting to get a copy of the simulator sent to us
*Attempt to add functionality to the app that utilizes the code we were able to find that will power cycle the GPS
*Research how to monitor power consumption on an Android device

REVIEW:
Met with Dr. Mosse 10/3/2019, he was able to send us the code from the previous capstone course that we will begin reviewing shortly to get an insight into the algorithms and simulator that has already been put in place
While at the meeting he also gave us a test Android phone that will be rooted to more easily test our implementation
We were both very busy will projects from other courses so not much was accomplished this past week, we will be ramping up this coming sprint

10/4/2019 - 10/11/2019 (Matthew Borbonus)
----------------------
*Attempting to finally seize control of the GPS on the newly acquired rooted Android device
*Possibly have a map loaded onto the application to provide a functional demo
*Review the code and simulator sent to us to get an idea of what we are working with, what we can improve upon, and look into porting this code to the Android application in the future

REVIEW:
Succesfully obtained control of the GPS unit and can be toggled in the application
Reviewed simulator to learn how it worked and what conditions it was testing (proved to not be very useful in our algorithm)

10/11/2019 - 10/18/2019 (Stephen Marhefka)
-----------------------
*Porting some of the components of the simulator/developing our own portions of the algorithm
*Add map to our Android app along with obtaining users current location and speed
*Meet with Dr. Mosse on 10/17/2019 to review progress & issues
