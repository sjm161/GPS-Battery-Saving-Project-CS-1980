1. First, be sure the phone is running Android Lollipop (5.x). If not, the rooting application we used to root the phones will not work.
2. Go to an internet browser on the phone and go to 'https://kingrootapp.net/'. Download the APK, install it, and give it any permissions it needs (just say yes--very safe)
3. Once installed, open KingRoot and press on the Root button
4. If the previous step succeeds, the phone has been successfully rooted; if not, repeat until it works.
5. Go the Google Play Store and search for an application called 'Link2SD' and install it with any permissions it needs
6. The last thing needed to prep the device is to go to Settings>Developer Settings and enable USB Debugging
7. After this, simply connecting the phone to your development computer and accepting the one screen pop up will allow the Android Studio to install the application onto the phone
  7.1 install Android Studio
  7.2 connect phone, accept RSA key
  7.3 observe that device is LGE Nexus 5 (drop down top middle)
  7.4 To install, simply press the green play button in the top of bar of Android Studio to build and install the application
      onto the phone
8. Once installed, open Link2SD, find the application you installed [GPS Optim_Project in this case], select it, press the 3 bars in the top right corner of the screen and select 'Convert to system app' (see IMPORTANT step 9; see IMPORTANT step 10) 
9. Any future installs of the application will require you to open Link2SD, select the application, open the menu like before, and select 'Integrate update into system'; if not, you will lose the changes.
10. If using a different computer, use LINK2SD to uninstall app (GPS Optim) before you install the new app with Android Studio (to renew the RSA key).
