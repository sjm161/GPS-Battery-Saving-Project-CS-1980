1. First, be sure the phone is running Android Lollipop (5.x). If not, the rooting application we used to root the phones will not work.
2. Go to an internet browser on the phone and go to 'https://kingrootapp.net/'. Download the APK, install it, and give it any permissions it needs
3. Once installed, open KingRoot and press on the Root button
4. If the previous step succeeds, the phone has been successfully rooted
5. Go the Google Play Store and search for an application called 'Link2SD' and install it with any permissions it needs
6. The last thing needed to prep the device is to go to Settings>Developer Settings and enable USB Debugging
7. After this, simply connecting the phone to your development computer and accepting the one screen pop up will allow the Android Studio to install the application onto the phone
8. To install, simply press the green play button in the top of bar of Android Studio to build and install the application onto the phone (making sure the device is selected in the dropdown near this button)
9. Once installed, open Link2SD, find the application you installed, select it, press the 3 bars in the top right corner of the screen and select 'Convert to system app'
10. Any future installs of the application will require you to open Link2SD, select the application, open the menu like before, and select 'Integrate update into system'
